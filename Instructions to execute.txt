1. Upload Files to S3 (Python)

Create a Python script that can connect to an S3 bucket and upload files to it.
Use the boto3 library to interact with the S3 API.
Implement logic to handle multiple files and upload them to the appropriate directories within the S3 bucket.


2. Implement Processing Algorithms for Local Processing (GoLang)

Develop GoLang functions that implement the processing algorithms for each file type (A, B, C).
Each function should take the file data as input and perform the required processing.
Test the processing algorithms locally with sample files to ensure they work correctly.


3. Create Worker Lambda Functions (GoLang)

Create separate Lambda functions for each file type (A, B, C).
Each Lambda function should be written in GoLang and contain the corresponding processing algorithm.
Implement logic in the Lambda function to fetch the file data from S3 and pass it to the processing algorithm.
Write the processed results back to S3.


4. Master Lambda Function (MasterLambda)

Create a master Lambda function that orchestrates the execution of worker Lambda functions.
Implement logic to retrieve the list of uploaded files from S3.
Analyze the file types and determine which worker Lambda function should process each file.
Spawn new worker Lambda functions for each file type and pass the corresponding file data.
Monitor the execution status of worker Lambda functions and handle potential errors.


5. Concurrent and Parallel Execution of Lambdas

Leverage AWS Lambda's concurrency features to execute multiple worker Lambda functions in parallel.
Use Lambda's asynchronous nature to handle multiple file processing tasks simultaneously.
Implement mechanisms to ensure that workers receive distinct file data and avoid conflicts.


6. Write Results to S3

Implement logic in the worker Lambda functions to write the processed results back to S3.
Use unique file names to store the processed results and avoid conflicts.
Ensure that the results are written to a designated directory within the S3 bucket.


7. Save Logs from Lambda

Configure each Lambda function to capture and store logs.
Use AWS CloudWatch Logs to centralize and manage the logs from all Lambda functions.
Implement filtering and aggregation techniques to analyze log data for debugging and performance monitoring.
